<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>OBJECT:</span></b>
To obtain the lowest number of points after playing all eleven hands of the
game.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>THE
CARDS:</span></b> The game consists of two 58-card decks. Each deck has three
Jokers and five suits: stars <span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>,
hearts <span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9829;</span>,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>clubs <span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9827;</span>,
spades <span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9824;</span>,
and diamonds <span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9830;</span>.
Each suit has eleven cards: 3 through 10, Jack, Queen and King.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>CARD
VALUES:</span></b> Each number card is worth its face value, the Jacks are 11
points, Queens are 12, Kings are 13, Jokers</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are 50, and the current wild card is 20 points. The wild
card changes from hand to hand. For each hand, the card that</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>matches the number of cards dealt in the hand is wild. Thus,
when three cards are dealt, the 3s are wild, when four</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cards are dealt, the 4s are wild, and so on until the last
hand when the Kings are wild. Jokers are always wild.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>RUNS:</span></b>
A run consists of a sequence of three or more cards of the same suit, e.g., 5<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9827;</span>, 6<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9827;</span>, 7<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9827;</span>, or 9<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>, 10<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>, J<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>, Q<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Any card in a run can be replaced by any wild card or Joker.
For example, when 7s are wild, a run could be made</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>from 9<span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9830;</span>,
7<span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9827;</span>, J<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9830;</span>, or 6<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9830;</span>, 7<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>, 7<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>, 9<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9830;</span>. You can have
as many wild cards or Jokers in a run as you wish (and they may be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>adjacent to each other).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>BOOKS:</span></b>
A book consists of three or more cards of the same value regardless of suit,
e.g., 8<span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9827;</span>, 8<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>, 8<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9824;</span>, or K<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9824;</span>, K<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9830;</span>, K<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9829;</span>,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>K<span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9829;</span>.
Any card in a book can be replaced by any wild card or Joker. For example, if
8s are wild, then a book could be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>8<span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9824;</span>,
Q<span style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9824;</span>, Q<span
style='font-family:"Segoe UI Symbol",sans-serif'>&#9733;</span>. You can have
as many wild cards or Jokers in a book as you wish (and they may be adjacent to
each</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>other).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>THE DEAL:</span></b>
Before each hand is dealt, all the cards (both decks) are shuffled together. In
the first hand, three cards</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>are dealt, one at a time in a clockwise direction starting
with the person to the dealer’s left. In each following hand,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the number of cards dealt increases by one; thus, the second
hand has four cards, the third hand has five cards, etc.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In the last hand of the game each player has thirteen cards.
After each deal, the remaining cards are placed in the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>center as a draw pile, and the top card is turned over to
start the discard pile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>THE PLAY:</span></b>
The player to the dealer’s left goes first, and play continues clockwise. Each
turn starts with either</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>drawing a card from the deck or picking up the top card from
the discard pile. The turn is completed by discarding</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>one card. A player can only lay down his/her books and/or
runs when going out or, in turn, after another player has</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>gone out (see GOING OUT).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When a player is able to go out, the remaining players each
have one last turn. Each remaining player, in turn, will</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>either draw from the deck or pick up the top discard. The
player will then lay down all his/her books and/or runs,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>discard one card, and count the cards remaining in his/her
hand as points against him/her. One cannot play on</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>another player’s books or runs. The value of the cards on
the table does not matter, only cards remaining unused in</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>the hand are counted. The scorekeeper records the points and
keeps a running tally.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The deal passes to the player on the dealer’s left, all
cards are shuffled and the next hand is dealt. The number of</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>cards dealt increases by one card each deal, and the wild
card changes as described above. Play continues until the</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>eleventh hand when the Kings are wild. Low score wins.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>GOING
OUT:</span></b> After drawing from the deck or picking up the top card from the
discard pile, if a player is able to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>arrange all the cards in his/her hand into books and/or runs
with one card remaining, he/she lays the cards down</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>and discards the one card to go out. The discard can be a
card that could have been played on the cards laid down.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>NOTES:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>1. Keep your options open. You can come from behind even in
the last hand...hence our slogan: The game isn’t over</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>‘til the Kings go wild!®</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>2. Whenever you are uncertain which card is wild, count the
number of cards you were dealt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>3. If you have only one wild card or Joker in your hand
after someone goes out and you can’t play it, you may wish to</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>discard it. This will cut your losses (wild cards and Jokers
are worth lots of points), but unfortunately it will probably</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>help your opponents.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>4. In the last hand of a seven player game, if all the
remaining cards in the deck are used, the discard pile should be</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>reshuffled and used to replenish the deck. Combine 2 games
and play with up to 14 people.</p>
